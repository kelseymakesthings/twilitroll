# This is a script that allows us to receive and reply 
# to a message. This is a small web application using a framework
# called Flask, and this can accept incoming HTTP requests that are 
# triggered when your Twilio number receives SMS messages. 
# In addition to running this script, you also need to get a public URL
# using something like ngrok, and enter that URL in your Messaging
# Service Inbound Settings.
